# Udacity-Rigall-Blog

I built this project from the ground up. I learned a lot through making it, as it is the first project I've ever attempted. I started really picking up speed in my understanding especially towards the end. I have a few more ideas to make it more fancy & flesh it out a bit, but other than that I'm happy with how it works so far. 

A few pieces of the code (like the javascript) were copied and adapted from W3 Schools. And while the content itself was taken from my wife's actual blog, no part of the code was copied.
