# Personal Blog - Udacity Project #1

## Overview
This is my first web project ever. It uses fairly basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a personal blog site. The content itself was taken from my wife's actual blog, but the code is all my own work, with a few exceptions which I copied and adapted from W3 Schools.

## HTML
Contains multiple pages, some of which will be filled out at a future date. I tried to use as much html syntax as I could when I wrote each page.

## CSS
My first foray into some major styling. I ended up breaking all the styles up into multiple files in an attempt to keep things simple and organized.

## JS
The JavaScript here is minimal and was not required in the project. It was mostly to include features that I wanted and didn't know how to do with CSS alone.
