# udacity-personal-blog

I learned a lot through making this project, as it is the first project I've ever attempted. I started really picking up speed in my understanding especially towards the end. I hope to flesh out all of my ideas soon.

A few pieces of the code (like the javascript) were copied and adapted from W3 Schools. And while the content itself was taken from my wife's actual blog, no part of the code was copied.
