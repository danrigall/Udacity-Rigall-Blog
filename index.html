        Hi! I'm Sam (Samwise, Samster, and Samus are also acceptable).
        There's really no non-awkard way to describe oneself,
        but I gave it a try below. You can also read more about why
        I started this blog here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lover of God, people, comedy, coffee, and honest conversation.
        Director of Marketing at a wonderfully dynamic tech
        startup called <a href="http://www.cotribute.com/" target="_blank">
        Co.tribute</a>, which, as the website describes is:
        <q>The digital platform to deliver amazing giving and volunteering experiences.</q>
        Really into Jimmy Fallon, grilled cheese sandwiches,
        New York City, and rainy days. Passionate about making a difference
        and helping others realize they can do the same.

      <h3>Don’t Talk While Hungry (and Other Marriage Lessons)</h3>
      <div class="date">March 7, 2019</div>
      <p>
        Today, it’s been six months since Dan and I got married.
        I haven’t written anything in awhile, because my brain and
        heart have just been too full - full of wedding plans, apartment set up,
        and many transition-related feelings. It was just too much to sift through,
        and while I planned to start blogging again in the fall during my break
        from school, as usual that turned out to be a little too ambitious.
        Will I ever learn? Probably not. It’s fine. <b>IT’S FINE.</b>

      <p>
          Okay, peeps. I promised myself that I would not dedicate any more
          posts to Harry Potter after the last one, because of social norms.
          But he might make a cameo at some point in the near future. <u>WHO KNOWS.</u>
          For now I’ll just tell you that I may have chased down a random
          employee at Universal who I <i>thought</i> was dressed as Harry
          (so that my little cousin could take a pic with him), but it turned
          out to be just a dude who works there with glasses.

      <p>
        Two weeks ago, I made a promise to Lisa Blair. We decided that we would
        each post something on our blogs by that Monday. Lisa, of course,
        stayed true to her word and posted some lovely thoughts right on time.
        I, however, procrastinated, lamented about my lack of creativity,
        pretended to study for my Finance midterm, and clicked repeatedly on
        articles with titles like <q>Must-Have Spring Shoes for Every Budget.</q>

      <p>
        Well hello there, all of you lovely Internet people. It’s been awhile.
        Mostly because business school has been pounding me into the ground
        a bit, but also because I haven’t been feeling particularly inspired.
        I kept starting posts and promptly deleting them, going to the kitchen
        for a snack, or getting distracted by <i>Stranger Things</i>. I would then
        proceed to dramatically text a friend about how I probably have <b>ADD</b> and
        will never succeed at life. But I digress.
